# [Next 14 starters with authentication and database set up](https://wedaolatam.com)

#### See the live demo [here](https://wedaolatam.com)

## Description:

Starter templates for [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) full-stack projects. Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [ShadCn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), authentication, and database. Several branches contain several different configurations, including serverless databases like PostgreSQL with [Neon](https://neon.tech), or MySQL with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), [Prisma ORM v.5](https://www.prisma.io/) (serverless-compatible), but also [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and even [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), [Express (MERN stack)](https://expressjs.com/), or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). All users are stored in a database, regardless of whether they signed up with email and password, magic link, or via an OAuth provider, such a Google or GitHub.
