## Description:
Wedi is a revolutionary solution for savings and spending in multiple currencies, to address the devaluation of local currencies and the need for a more stable and secure way to save and spend money. Wedi is a digital platform for payments and transactions procesing, using stablecoins like USDC to purchase in any place while paying in local currency, reducing fees and speeding the process.

Using thirdweb Account Abstractions, we can easily onboard new users and provide them with a digital wallet that allows them to save and spend in multiple currencies using Circle API. The whole system is built around an AI assistant that personalizes the interaction, data and recommendations for each user, providing a unique experience and a more efficient way to manage their finances.
